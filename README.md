# Challenge 1 - Danny's Dinner

Introduction:

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Problem Statement:

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:

sales,
menu,
members.

# Challenge 2 - Pizza Runner

Introduction:

Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

Problem Statement:

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

    - Pizza Metrics
    - Runner and Customer Experience
    - Ingredient Optimisation
    - Pricing and Ratings
    - Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

# SQL Case Study 2 - Human Resources

Introduction:

In a dynamic corporate environment, managing departments, employees, and projects efficiently is essential for organizational success. The provided SQL schema represents a typical company structure with departments managed by dedicated individuals, employees engaged in various roles, and projects driving departmental objectives. Leveraging this data, we aim to address pertinent challenges to enhance operational effectiveness and employee management.

Problem Statement:

Within this corporate framework, we encounter several key challenges. 

    - Firstly, identifying the longest ongoing project in each department is crucial for resource allocation and project prioritization. 
    - Secondly, delineating employees who are not managers facilitates targeted management strategies and career progression plans. 
    - Thirdly, pinpointing employees hired after project commencement within their department assists in assessing recruitment efficiency and project alignment. 
    - Additionally, ranking employees based on hire dates enables fair performance evaluations and career trajectory planning. 
    - Lastly, computing the duration between consecutive employee hires within departments sheds light on workforce dynamics and succession planning opportunities. 
    
Through comprehensive analysis and strategic insights derived from SQL queries, we aim to address these challenges effectively, fostering organizational excellence and employee satisfaction.
